Welcome to a LeetCode Study Session focused on **Stacks**, **Queues**, and the **Monotonic Pattern**. we've included some notes to refer too, and some problems to solve.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand and implement **Stacks (LIFO)** and **Queues (FIFO)**.
- Recognise and apply the **Monotonic Stack/Queue** pattern.
- Solve classic stack and queue problems and be able to apply these data structures in more unfamiliar problems.

## ðŸ”‘ Quick Reference

| Structure           | Core Ops                       | Amortised | Use Cases                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Stack (LIFO)**    | `push`, `pop`, `top`, `empty`  | O(1)      | Parsing (), backtracking, *next greater*       |
| **Queue (FIFO)**    | `push`, `pop`, `front`, `empty`| O(1)      | BFS, scheduling, streaming                     |
| **Monotonic Stack** | Maintain â†‘/â†“ order             | O(n)      | NGE/NS, daily temps, stock span                |
| **Monotonic Queue** | Window max/min with deque      | O(n)      | Sliding window extrema                         |

> **Tip:** Store **indices** (not just values) when you need positions or window checks.
